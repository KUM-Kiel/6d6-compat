# Install

Just type

  $ sudo make install

This will install the Software to /usr/local/bin.

Now you have the following commands.

## 6d6copy

  Copy a SD card to tho file system.

  Use it as follows:

    $ 6d6copy /dev/sdX1 file.6d6

  This will copy the contents of /dev/sdX1 to file.6d6.
  Replace X with the proper drive letter.
  On some systems this could also be /dev/mmcblk0p1 or similar.

## 6d6read

  Convert a .6d6 file to .s2x.

  Use it as follows:

    $ 6d6read < in.6d6 > out.s2x

  Note the angle brackets! The are important!

  This converts the input .6d6 file to .s2x.

  With this format you probably have to correct the skew manually with the Send2X tools!

# Install

Just type

  $ sudo ./install

This will install the Software to /usr/local/bin.

If you want to install to another directory, you can specify it like so:

  $ sudo ./install PREFIX=/path/to/dir

Note that 'bin' will be appended to the path. The default is PREFIX=/usr/local.

Now you have the following commands.

6d6info
-------

  Show info about a 6D6 file, StiK or SD card.

  Use it as follows:

    $ 6d6info /dev/sdX1

  This will show info for /dev/sdX1.
  Replace X with the proper drive letter.
  On some systems this could also be /dev/mmcblk0p1 or similar.

6d6copy
-------

  Copy a SD card to tho file system.

  Use it as follows:

    $ 6d6copy /dev/sdX1 file.6d6

  This will copy the contents of /dev/sdX1 to file.6d6.
  Replace X with the proper drive letter.
  On some systems this could also be /dev/mmcblk0p1 or similar.

6d6mseed
--------

  Convert a .6d6 file to MiniSEED.

  Use it as follows:

    $ 6d6mseed --station=CODE file.6d6

  This will convert file.6d6 to MiniSEED. Setting the station code is required.
  For information about other options use the following command:

    $ 6d6mseed --help

6d6read
-------

  Convert a .6d6 file to .s2x.

  Use it as follows:

    $ 6d6read < in.6d6 > out.s2x

  Note the angle brackets! They are important!

  This converts the input .6d6 file to .s2x.

  With this format you probably have to correct the skew manually with the Send2X tools!
